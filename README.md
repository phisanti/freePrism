The goal of freePrism is to provide a platform for statistical analysis
similar to Prism for free. This app should allow you to perform simple
statistical analysis such as two sample comparison, multiple sample
comparion, ANOVA, and linear models. You can easily upload your data and
then get you p-values. Then, download the plot and modify it as required
for your publication!
