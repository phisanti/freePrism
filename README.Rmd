The goal of freePrism is to provide a platform for statistical analysis similar to Prism for free. This app should allow you to perform simple statistical analysis such as two sample comparison, multiple sample comparion, ANOVA, and linear models. You can easily upload your data and then get you p-values. Then, download the plot and modify it as required for your publication!

## Local Installation

You can install the development version of freePrism from this repository:

``` r
remotes::install_github("https://github.com/phisanti/freePrism")
```
## Use

Once the package is installed, to run the app locally simply use the command:

``` r
freePrism::run_app()
```

## Usage
To begin using freePrism, you need to upload your own data using the side menu. Once your data is uploaded, you can choose which statistical test you would like to perform by selecting one of the available tabs.

Each tab corresponds to a different statistical test, and you can input your desired commands and arguments for each test in the side menu. Once you have entered your inputs, click the 'Run Analysis' button to execute the test.

After running the test, the results will be displayed on the main page along with your data. Additionally, you have the option to plot the data and download the generated plots in PDF format for further editing.

## Feedback

If you would like to suggest any new functionality or if you notice any bug, do not hesitate to submit an issue. This tool is still an a experimental level.

Thank you for using freePrism!
