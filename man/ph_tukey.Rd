\title{Conducts post-hoc pairwise comparisons after an ANOVA test.}
\usage{
ph_tukey(d, treatment, variable, p.adjust.method = "bonferroni")
}
\arguments{
\item{d}{A data frame containing the data to be analyzed.}

\item{treatment}{A string specifying the name of the categorical variable that defines the groups to be compared.}

\item{variable}{A string specifying the name of the continuous variable to be analyzed.}

\item{p.adjust.method}{A string specifying the method used to adjust p-values for multiple comparisons. Default is "bonferroni".}
}
\value{
A data table containing the results of the pairwise comparisons, including the names of the compared groups, the difference in means, the standard error, the t-value, the degrees of freedom, the p-value, and any adjustment for multiple testing.
}
\description{
This function conducts post-hoc pairwise comparisons between groups in a 
dataset, after an ANOVA test has indicated significant differences among the 
groups. The function uses the Tukey's Honestly Significant Difference (HSD) 
test to compare all possible pairwise differences between the groups.
